Older Americans typically require more frequent health care, and like many other states with a larger than typical ambulatory health care services sector, Arizona is home to a relatively large retirement-age population. Nearly 17% of the state resident are 65 or older, a far greater share than the 15.2% of Americans nationwide","2", "3", "4","5","6","California: Computer and electronic product manufacturing. \n Computer and electronic product manufacturing includes the production of semiconductors, navigational equipment, and communications equipment. The sector differs from other manufacturing subsectors as it involves highly specialized, miniaturized, technologically advanced components. The largest industry in California after real estate, computer and electronics manufacturing also is rapidly growing. The sector contributed $99.0 billion to the state's economy in 2016, a more than 50% increase from half a decade prior."];
